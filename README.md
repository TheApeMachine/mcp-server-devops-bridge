## üß† Memory System

The bridge implements an intelligent memory system that enables AI assistants to automatically:

1. **Retrieve relevant memories** before responding to queries
2. **Store important context** from interactions for future reference

### Memory Architecture

The memory system uses a dual-store approach:

- **Vector Storage (Qdrant)** - For semantic search of unstructured text
- **Graph Database (Neo4j)** - For entity relationships and structured queries

### Automatic Memory Integration

The system includes a middleware layer that enhances MCP tools with memory capabilities:

```go
// Apply memory middleware to any tool handler
wrappedHandler := MemoryMiddleware(originalHandler)
```

This middleware:

1. Automatically searches for relevant memories based on the tool and query
2. Injects found memories into the context before the response
3. Extracts and stores important information from interactions

### Memory Flow

1. **Query Phase**: Before processing a tool request

   - Extract query context from the tool parameters
   - Search vector and graph stores for relevant memories
   - Format memories for inclusion in the response

2. **Response Phase**: After processing a tool request
   - Analyze the response for important information
   - Use OpenAI to extract structured knowledge
   - Store in both vector and graph databases

### Benefits

- **Contextual Awareness**: AI can recall relevant facts from previous interactions
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Important information is automatically preserved
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Context is maintained between different conversations
- **Transparent Enhancement**: Memory injection is automatic and seamless

### Usage

Memory-enhancing specific tools is simple:

```go
// Create your tool
myTool := mcp.NewTool("my_tool", /* ... */);

// Original handler function
func handleMyTool(ctx context.Context, request mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {
    // Tool implementation
}

// Wrap with memory middleware
wrappedHandler := MemoryMiddleware(handleMyTool)

// Register with MCP server
mcpServer.AddTool(myTool, wrappedHandler)
```

### Configuration

The memory system can be configured through environment variables:

```bash
# Vector Store (Qdrant)
export QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6333"
export QDRANT_API_KEY="your-qdrant-api-key"

# Graph Database (Neo4j)
export NEO4J_URL="http://localhost:7474"
export NEO4J_USER="neo4j"
export NEO4J_PASSWORD="your-neo4j-password"

# OpenAI (for memory extraction)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
```

# MCP Server DevOps Bridge with Agent System

This repository contains the code for an MCP (Mission Control Panel) server DevOps bridge with a powerful agent system that allows AI models to create, manage, and coordinate long-running agents.

## Overview

The system allows AI models to:

1. Create new long-running agents with customized system prompts and tasks
2. Send commands to existing agents
3. Facilitate communication between agents through a messaging system
4. Monitor and manage agent lifecycles

## Key Components

### Agent Management

The system provides tools for:

- **Creating Agents**: Create new agents with custom system prompts and tasks
- **Listing Agents**: View all running agents and their status
- **Sending Commands**: Send instructions or queries to specific agents
- **Subscribing to Topics**: Have agents listen for messages on specific channels
- **Killing Agents**: Terminate agents when they're no longer needed

### Inter-Agent Communication

Agents can communicate with each other through:

- **Message Bus**: A central messaging system that routes messages to subscribed agents
- **Topics**: Channels that agents can publish to and subscribe to
- **Direct Commands**: Send direct instructions to specific agents

### System Tools

The system provides tools for:

- **Command Execution**: Run system commands with proper security controls
- **Messaging**: Send and receive messages between agents
- **Agent Management**: Create, monitor, and terminate agents

## Usage

### Creating and Coordinating Agents

```go
// Get all agent-related tools
tools := ai.GetAllToolsAsOpenAI()

// Create an OpenAI client
client := openai.NewClient()

// Use OpenAI to coordinate agents
messages := []openai.ChatCompletionMessageParamUnion{
    openai.SystemMessage(`You are a coordinator of AI agents.`),
    openai.UserMessage("Create two agents and have them work together."),
}

// Call OpenAI with our tools
params := openai.ChatCompletionNewParams{
    Model:    openai.F(openai.ChatModelGPT4o),
    Messages: openai.F(messages),
    Tools:    openai.F(tools),
}

// Process the response and handle tool calls
// ...
```

### Example Agent Workflow

1. **Create Agents**: Create specialized agents for different tasks

   ```
   Tool: agent
   Arguments: {"id": "researcher", "system_prompt": "You are a research agent...", "task": "Find information about climate change"}
   ```

2. **Subscribe to Topics**: Have agents listen for relevant messages

   ```
   Tool: subscribe_agent
   Arguments: {"agent_id": "writer", "topic": "research_results"}
   ```

3. **Send Messages**: Share information between agents

   ```
   Tool: send_agent_message
   Arguments: {"topic": "research_results", "content": "Here is the information I found..."}
   ```

4. **Send Commands**: Give direct instructions to agents
   ```
   Tool: send_command
   Arguments: {"agent_id": "writer", "command": "Summarize the research in 3 paragraphs"}
   ```

## Security

The system implements several security measures:

- Agents only have access to the commands and paths explicitly granted to them
- Command execution is containerized to provide isolation
- All communication is managed through controlled channels

## Getting Started

See the `examples/agent_example.go` file for a complete example of how to use the agent system to create and coordinate multiple agents.
